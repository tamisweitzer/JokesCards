React tutorial to build a jokes app

This is from a tutorial on Medium called 'Build Your First React Single Page App' by Tom.

The tutorial uses VS Code, Node.js, Debugger for Chrome, Assessibility Insights, ESLint, Sublime Babel and Prettier.

The tutorial walks through setting up a simple app that has jokes written on cards. 
The user can click on a button on the card to reveal the punchline.

At the end of the tutorial you walk through a simple accessiblity check using Chrome's Assessibility Insights.
